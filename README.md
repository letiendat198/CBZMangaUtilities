# CBZ Manga Utilities (CMU)

A tool to save myself hours of removing ads from mangas crawled from the seven seas
and preparing them for KCC (Kindle Comic Converter) to use on my Kindle

Also to rework my GUI skill a bit (This time GUI actually have a nice separation of GUI from backend)


## Features (Or what will be the features)

- Sort pages into groups (colored repeating, colored unique, b&w repeating, b&w unique)
- Add or remove such groups into/from the final product (Rapid removal of ads from pirate sites)
- Compress JPEG images to save space
- Export to KCC-compatible format
- Will add more when need arise :D
